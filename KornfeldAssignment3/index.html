		<h1> Homes in Flood Zones Face Extra Stress on Sewage Systems </h1>

		<p>Flooding and storms pose many risks to New York City residents across the five boroughs, yet many New Yorkers don’t necessarily think about how living near the coast can exacerbate sewage issues. Combined sewer systems -- in which domestic sewage is not separated from stormwater runoff and industrial waste -- are common in New York; according to the city’s environmental agency, 60% of New York City has a combined sewer system. Heavy rain, snow, and storms can cause these combined sewers to overflow, spilling a mix of human waste and industrial waste into water bodies and causing sewer backups in homes. Since January 2019, there have been a little over 11,000 sewage backups reported to the city's 311 hotline, across the 5 boroughs.</p>

		<p>FEMA is currently in the process of redrawing and expanding their flood maps. Compared to the outdated floodmaps that have been used for years, these new flood maps are seeking to capture areas that are at high-risk of flood inundation, as sea levels rise and storms become more frequent and intense. Homes in low-lying topography were particularly vulnerable to flooding after Hurricane Sandy, and many residents affected by Sandy reported not just flooding due to stormwater, but flooding from backed-up sewer systems too. For example, homes near Coney Island Creek, a small estuary located between the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Gravesend and Coney Island, were heavily flooded with both stormwater and sewage-filled water after Hurricane Sandy, according to a 2016 city study.</p>

		<p>“The more infiltration in sewer systems, the higher likelihood you’ll have sewage backups in your home,” said Dr. Sara Heger, an engineer and researcher in the Onsite Sewage Treatment Program at the University of Minnesota’s Water Resources Center. According to Heger, a lot of sewer infiltration issues arise when there is old piping and cracks in the system that cause leaks, and also when the sewers are combined sewer systems. Flooding can put additional stress on already taxed sewer systems.To mitigate the risks of sewage backups, Dr. Heger suggests installing a backwater prevention valve, or considering green infrastructure like rain gardens, which help soak up excess water from roofs, driveways or streets.
